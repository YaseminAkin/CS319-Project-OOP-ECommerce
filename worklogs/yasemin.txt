Week 1: 18â€“22 September
  We formed our group and I have sent an email  to our TA Yahya according to make the group approved.

Week 2: 25-29 September
  We met for our first meeting and talked about previous experiences and what each group member would like to do in order to contribute to the project.
Decided on a second meeting date to write README for out GitHub repo. At the second meeting, we wrote README and brainstromed aboutb the project.
Decided on our tech stack and to open React and Java Spring projects and push them to GitHub as well as initalizing a database somehow. I created 
a React+Vite project in JetBrains IDE WebStorm and pushed it to our repo and talked a little with Murat about database formation. Also I have drawn a basic class diagram 
to have a generic idea about the backend side of our project. In the next week, we plan to test front, back and database connection by testing if a pilot request and respond duo behave as intended.
